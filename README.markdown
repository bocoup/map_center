This is the prototype for the election map center.

Things this does have:
    * National maps with state and county boundaries
    * State maps with county boundaries
    * Support for converting between county names and FIPS codes
    * Support for converting between state names and USPS abbreviations
    * Custom named colors in Javascript and CSS
    * Gradual loading of county maps to avoid "browser unresponsive" errors
    * (Relatively) current senatorial counts
    * Electoral College results back to 1964 with interactive calculator
    * Patchwork Nation county classifications

Things this doesn't have:
    * Decent IE<9 support (exists in theory, but not quite there)
    * An actual UI design (i.e., more than needed to test basic functionality)
    * Functionality from deadlines other than October 31 (unfunded)
    * Connections to server-side data sources
