This is the prototype for the election map center.

Things this does have:

* National maps with state and county boundaries
* State maps with county boundaries
* Support for converting between county names and FIPS codes
* Support for converting between state names and USPS abbreviations
* Custom named colors in Javascript and CSS
* Gradual loading of county maps to avoid "browser unresponsive" errors
* (Relatively) current senatorial counts
* Electoral College results back to 1964 with interactive calculator
* Patchwork Nation county classifications

Things this doesn't have:

* Functionality from deadlines other than October 31 (unfunded)
* Connections to server-side data sources
